# Open Data Standards (ODS)
ODS is curated by Oasis LMF and governed by the Open Data Standards Steering Committee (SC) which consists of attendees from (re)insurers, brokers and cat model vendors. 
The two main aspects of ODS are the Open Exposure Data and the Open Results Data. 

## Open Exposure Data (OED)
    
The aim of OED is to provide the industry with a robust, open and transparent data format. 
This will improve efficiency and transparency for the cat modelling community, facilitating data transfer and analytics across models and vendors.
OED is a model agnostic data format that comprises of four input files (Acc, Loc, RI Scope, RI Info).
A SQL Server schema is also available.
OED is directly supported by the Oasis Loss Modelling Framework.

## Open Results Data (ORD)

    Coming soon!

ORD was developed during the Lloyd's Lab innovation project in November 2019 by a working group focussed on constructing model agnostic results formats and approriate data formats. 
These model outputs cover an extensive suite of results that can captured by exposure, financial and statistical perspectives.
ORD will be adopted by the Oasis Loss Modelling Framework

## Governence

ODS is governed by a steering committee that meets every quarter and is chaired by Oasis LMF. The committee is made up of representatives from the following companies:
