# OED Cyber

### Introduction

There is an increasing demand for a set of agreed open standards for cyber business. It makes sense for the whole industry that these standards are developed in line with current standards for property and liability business and should be encapsulated in the ODS process and format. Please refer to the GitHub Repository (https://github.com/OasisLMF/ODS_OpenExposureData) or the ODS webpage (https://oasislmf.org/open-data-standards) for further information.

It’s important to note that this is NOT an Oasis standard but a market initiative that is only curated by Oasis and so the success of ODS is reliant on community collaboration. The aim of ODS is not to serve or be controlled by a single entity for their own commercial benefit, but to accommodate multiple developers and users, be open and transparent for all.

Throughout 2022, a working group of practitioners from the companies listed below have consulted on various approaches and the majority have agreed on what key data fields need to be included in this standard. 

&nbsp;

### Rationale

This data standard is primarily intended to ensure a degree of consistency in policy-level data capture and to enable efficient sharing of select data fields across the industry. Other than the benefit of reduced frictional cost, wide-spread adoption of the schema should enable portfolio managers to implement granular, accurate and robust exposure management procedures. This can, in turn, enable sophisticated risk accumulation and/or cyber modelling use cases.

Eventually it was decided that the preferred approach was to make this schema as succinct and prescriptive as possible to ensure consistency of the data formats and to keep any ambiguity to a minimum. Therefore, any supported options or specific date formats are included in the ‘descriptions’ to support the user and promote the opportunity for data to be machine-readable.

The main contention during the working group sessions was around the inclusion of technographic data fields and how they may be captured. Some thought that due to the limited amount of technographic data that is currently captured in the market and due to its poor quality, these fields should not be included in a first version of this standard. Others, especially reinsurers concluded that even some of this data is useful for basic accumulation analytics if there were supporting messages around them.

Most of the working group agreed that a handful of basic fields should be included in the first version with some accompanying notes in the 'Read Me' tab. We encourage all users to read the considerations in the 'Read Me' tab of the data spec document.

&nbsp;

### Next Steps

As the cyber modelling and underwriting space is still in its infancy, the data capture and data quality in the market is improving continuously and so the first version of this data standard is intended as a 'first attempt' to get a consistent and open data format for the market. As adoption increases, the aim is to develop this standard further with feedback from the community.

Any feedback and suggestions for updates should be submitted via the 'issues' here (https://github.com/OasisLMF/OpenDataStandards/issues) which will then be reviewed by the Technical Working Group (TWG).

&nbsp;

### Governance

A cyber steering committee (CSC) will be set up following some market adoption and companies in the cyber space will be represented to oversee the development of this standard. The CSC will act as a "sub-committee" into the main ODS SC and will follow the same governance and signoff process.
