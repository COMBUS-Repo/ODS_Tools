1,"For audit need to ensure that we capture all infomarmation that enables an anlysis to be reproduced: versions, exposure data, analysis settings, times / dates of analysis. Should consider the use of hash / checksum information to ensure nothing has changed post-analysis."
2,Should include disaggregation information - has original exposure information been disaggregated by the model or not?
3,Need to ensure that multi-model results from one 'run' can be brought together consistently into one period loss table. For example using an EnsembleID that ties together a number of different 'analyses'. Or introducing a ModelRegionId in the PLTs.
4,"Loss results should be usable on their own (no other lookups to find original values from IDs) - the results file itself should be the only file I need to interpret the results..the fact you can't achieve this at present makes Oasis harder to use. Likewise, naming of files should not result in identical file names."
5,Marginal impact results should be able to be stored in ORD
6,How do we capture grouping by reinstatements / losses by reinstatements? Output file with layers affected and count reinstatements?
7,"Should include uncertainty from ensemble members resulting from sensitivity testing (not secondary uncertainty). We seek a more flexible expression of uncertainty in results than just a SD. As we implement an ensemble modelling approach driven by SAFE, we will have greater power to derive more informative output; for example an empirical loss distribution within an ELT or for a given point on a loss curve. Also the output formats mustn't assume a single model run with internal sampling will always be appropriate; our current view is towards multiple model runs driven by, and with input parameters perturbed by, a sensitivity analysis toolset like SAFE."
8,"We need to consider metrics beyond insurance / reinsurance loss: number of locations affected, number of people killed, number of people injured, number of people displaced etc. Which metrics should be included? here will be metrics other than input TIV and ouput financial loss which become important, e.g. km of infrastructure affected, number of population affected, number of locations affected; these may all replace $$ on one axis of an EP curve or in an ELT. We don't have a definitive list, as we are just starting to discover what some of these outputs may be."
9,We need to consider the mechanism for ensuring that only users who have licensed a model can access a model's results - part of the technology solution or a business issue?
10,For the model metadata part we need to ensure the package can include a range of formats - e.g. shapefiles - so that a broad range of information can be included. Can the chosen technology do this?
11,"Is there a way of being able to trace back everything that has happened to give rise to the loss at a given location (reinsurance applied, models run etc). Essentially full audit trail at a location level rather than an anlysis level?"
12,Can we add the facility to easily anonymise results / exposures for external distribution?
13,Should include grid-cell resolution in model metadata: hazard
